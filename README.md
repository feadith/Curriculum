# Curriculum
This repo contains the readme file that list all the learning videos uploaded in FEADITH Technologies channel. You can use this list to guide you study through all the materials as needed. At the moment, FEADITH focused on learning ABAQUS software for various types of problem including modeling failure in metals, polymers and composite materials for both static and dynamic loadings. In near future, we will cover other software such as LS-DYNA and ANSYS, specifically for modeling of composite material first since this topic is very close to our current research.
